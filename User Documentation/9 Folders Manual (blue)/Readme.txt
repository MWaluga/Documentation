Note: This Scan-Job is in progress. I hope to finish it until end of 2021.

The 2-letter abbreviation on each folder combined with a chapter number (2-digit) is used in the Master Index (RG-04 = Reference Guide Chapter 4, IN-02 = Introduction Chapter 2, etc.), so I decided to use these also as prefixes for the documents in the folders. 

For scanning I have chosen the B5 format. 
My HP Scanner did not offer a format that comes closer to the page size which is 7,5 x 8,5 inch.
So pages are slightly longer than they must be:(
