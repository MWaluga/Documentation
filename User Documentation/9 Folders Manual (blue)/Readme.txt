Note: A good starting point if you are searching for a topic is the "RG-06 Master Index.pdf" in folder "1 Reference Guide".

The 2-letter abbreviation on each folder combined with a chapter number (2-digit) is used in the Master Index (RG-04 = Reference Guide Chapter 4, IN-02 = Introduction Chapter 2, etc.), so I decided to use these also as prefixes for the documents in the folders. 

For scanning I have chosen the B5 format. 
My HP-Scanner did not offer a format that comes closer to the page size which is 7,5 x 8,5 inch.
So pages are slightly longer than they must be:(
