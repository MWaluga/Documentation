Note: This Scan-Job is in progress. I hope to finish it during the coming 2 months.

The 2-letter abbreviation on each folder (RG = Reference Guide, IN = Introduction, etc.) is used in the Master Index, 
so I decided to use ese also as a prefix for the chapters in the folders. 

For scanning I have chosen the B5 format. 
My HP Scanner did not offer a format that comes closer to the page size which is 7,5 x 8,5 inch.
So pages are slightly longer than they must be:(
