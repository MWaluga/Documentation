The powerful and easy to use SCRIPT musical notation system fills the needs of professional musicians. 
lt is uncomplicated and similar in concept to standard musical notation. 

Yet it allows the musician precise control over many subtle aspects of music composition and performance.
You simply type in a composition's pitches, rhythm, and dynamics, and any other aspect of the piece. 
A motif may be repeated, played with different timbres, or subjected to the retrograde, transposition, 
or inversion operations of tonal music.
