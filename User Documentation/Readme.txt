The first manual was the Synclavier II Instruction Manual from around 1981.
The documentation that came in 3 folders was from around 1985/86.
Later on with the 3200, 6400 and 9600 models and the Tapeless Studio concept the manuals were re-organized
into more folders for specific topics. The "blue manuals" that I own are in 3 boxes with 3 folders each in a more handy format.

Any additional information you might have on the history of documentation is welcome :)
Note: In some cases title pages or tables of content did not fit into the page numbering of a chapter.
      In such cases I separated such pages to keep the pagenumbers in the main document according to the numbers printed.

Many thanks to "Nathan Nednerd" for letting me scan the Synclavier II manual for you all!
